# BayesSpec

This is a simple repository for example PyMC3 (https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/) scripts with applications to inference of earthquake source spectral parameters. The example script `pymc3_specratio_example.py` outlines one potential workflow in this regard. It is deliberately generic and well-commented such that users can adapt to their datasets of interest.
